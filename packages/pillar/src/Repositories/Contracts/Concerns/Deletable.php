/**
 * Contract for DELETE operations.
 *
 * Defines methods for removing records from the database.
 *
 * ## Model Lifecycle
 *
 * - `delete()`, `deleteOrFail()` - Direct query builder (bypasses model lifecycle, faster)
 * - `deleteBy()`, `deleteByOrFail()` - Uses Eloquent models (triggers events, respects soft deletes)
 * - `deleteById()`, `deleteByIdOrFail()` - Uses Eloquent model (triggers events, respects soft deletes)
 *
 * ## Soft Deletes
 *
 * If your model uses the `SoftDeletes` trait:
 * - `delete()`, `deleteOrFail()` will perform a hard delete (permanently removes records)
 * - `deleteBy()`, `deleteByOrFail()`, `deleteById()`, `deleteByIdOrFail()` will soft delete (sets deleted_at)
 *
 * ## Performance Comparison
 *
 * | Method | Queries | Model Lifecycle | Use Case |
 * |--------|---------|-----------------|----------|
 * | delete() | 1 | No | Bulk deletes, performance critical |
 * | deleteOrFail() | 1 | No | Bulk deletes with validation |
 * | deleteBy() | N+1 | Yes | When lifecycle matters for multiple records |
 * | deleteById() | 2 | Yes | Single record with lifecycle |
